<h1>ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM</h1>
<p>This is a created as a school project where I created a demo application for a Bank where customers can perform different actions 
  like sending and receiving money, checking bank balance , details and transaction history. It also has a admin side that can be used by 
  the bank to check the transaction and some details of the customer without hampering the customers privacy.</p>
